        All my life I was seeking the right tool to express my creativity and passion. Finlay, I can proudly say that I found myself in
        coding. What started with a simple “Hello World” has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as time goes
        by, engaging me to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality web apps in the future. I'm React developer
        based in Belgrade,Serbia.
